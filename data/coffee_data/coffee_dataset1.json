Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from traditional varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a \u201cnatural\u201d or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is less predictable and deeper than the more familiar wet-processed floral- and citrus-toned Yirgacheffe profile. Argyle Coffee Roasters aims to provide people the opportunity to drink better coffee through education, outreach, and creating connections. Visit www.argylecoffeeroasters.com for more information.",
