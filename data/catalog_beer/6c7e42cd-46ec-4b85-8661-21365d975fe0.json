  "description": "Inspired by the Trappist brewers in Belgium, the Quardupel is a Belgian style ale that is typically dark, strong, and bold in flavor. Our Quadraphonic is no exception. Quadraphonic is deep brown in color with reddish hues. It bursts with flavors of dark fruits, chocolate, and raisins, with a long rich finish. This beer is designed for celebration and decadence, and hides it's 10.5% ABV well.",
