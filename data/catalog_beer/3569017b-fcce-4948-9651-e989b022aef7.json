  "description": "IRMA is a beer brewed for hurricane relief. In the aftermath of hurricane IRMA, several South Florida Breweries teamed up to brew this beer at MIA Brewing, with ingredients donated by suppliers. This is an IPA brewed with hops that spell IRMA: Idaho, Rakau, Mosaic, and Amarillo. As Barrel of Monks participated in this brew, we are glad to provide you with a rare chance to drink an IPA in our tasting room. Profits from the sale of this beer will go to Feeding Florida (www.feedingflorida.org).",
