  "description": "This traditional German Lager is brewed for Oktoberfest, the annual celebration of autumn. Malt flavors of light caramel and toasted bread are balanced by the delicate grassy aromas of European hops. Several months of cold storage (i.e. lagering) creates a clean, crisp and approachable beer. Headybrah is released on the same date as the start of the Oktoberfest Festival in Munich, which actually starts during the end of September.",
