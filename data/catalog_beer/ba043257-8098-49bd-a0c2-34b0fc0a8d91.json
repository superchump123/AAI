  "description": "Unfiltered IPA with great hop aroma and flavor. Bitterness is present but not overpowering with a healthy dose of Citra, Mosiac and Idaho 7. This IPA packs a punch of pine resin with a backend note of citrus. This delight operates at 7.4% abv to round out the whole picture. Enjoy!",
