  "description": "Former Mountain Sun brewer Scott Overdorf, who now owns Hobart Brewing in Tasmania, masterfully balanced various malts, vanilla and oak to create an \u201cOld World-Style\u201d stout with barrel-aged character. The combination of smoked malt and the additions of pure vanilla extract and toasted oak spirals give the impression of a barrel-aged stout without having undergone the barrel-aging process.",
