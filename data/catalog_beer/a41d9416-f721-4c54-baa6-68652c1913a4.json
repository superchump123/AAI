  "description": "Saison is a funny category of beer. They can take the form of super funky farmhouse ales, full of earthy or even horsey aromas and flavors (horsey tastes better than it sounds, rest assured!). On the other end of the spectrum, you have the clean refined flavors or zesty spice and light, tart citrus. Our Nuance is very much in latter category, dry and effervescent with subtle spice notes that blend seamlessly with light floral hops. Neither big nor bold, it is a little more\u2026nuanced.",
