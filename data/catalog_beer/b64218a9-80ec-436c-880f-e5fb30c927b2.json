  "description": "In a world full of over bitter IPAs, our Endless Enigma is the perfect blend, plenty of hop flavor and aroma without the mouth-numbing bitterness that many pale ales offer. Old world hops lend grassy, herbaceous notes to the flavors of caramel malt and banana. Now let us be clear, there is absolutely nothing wrong with a big, bold and bitter beer, but we simply lean towards offering a bit more malt balance and yeast character in our Belgian Pale Ale.",
