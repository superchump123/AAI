  "description": "While Belgian monks have brought us boldly flavored and high octane beers such as Tripels and Quadrupels, the beer that they are most likely drinking themselves is a Singel or Patersbeir. Like those monks, at Barrel of Monks you\u2019ll likely see us enjoying this clean and refreshing beer regularly as there is always something to be done and staying on as even a keel as possible is key. It\u2019s both the perfect beer to begin your quest into the world of Belgian Ales and an ideal choice after a long day of toil and trouble.",
