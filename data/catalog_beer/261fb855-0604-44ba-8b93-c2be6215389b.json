  "style": "Westcoast IPA",
  "description": "This West Coast I.P.A. is copper in color and medium-bodied with an aggressive hop bitterness, which is signature to this style. Malt flavors of caramel and light toast provide a sturdy backdrop for the hops to shine. German Ariana hops lend a resinous backbone while Bravo hops impart citrus notes reminiscent of orange and tangerine, which are complemented by the classic grapefruit character of Chinook hops.",
