  "description": "Wet Hopped Sly Boogie Session IPA is wet-hopped with Centennial Hops grown here at Triton Brewing Company\u00ae! This delightful, hoppy IPA is a very small batch and (sadly) when it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone. The Wet Hopped Sly will only be available on draft. Sorry no growler fills.",
