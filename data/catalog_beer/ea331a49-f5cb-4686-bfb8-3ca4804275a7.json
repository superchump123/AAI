  "style": "Imperial IPA",
  "description": "Our award-winning American Imperial I.P.A. is medium-bodied and copper in color. It receives multiple dry-hop additions, which provide explosive aromas of pineapple, citrus, pine and a hint of resiny dankness. The malts provide a solid backbone and flavors of light caramel which complement the hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.",
