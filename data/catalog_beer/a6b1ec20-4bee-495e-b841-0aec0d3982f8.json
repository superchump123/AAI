  "description": "St\u00f6rtebeker Roggen-Weizen is a robust dark wheat beer, known for its creamy body and a blend of vanilla and fruit aromas that tantalize the palate. It's unfiltered, top-fermented and made from rye and wheat, which contributes to its rich, chestnut brown color and full-bodied taste. The combination of rye, wheat, roasted, and caramel malts provide a deep hue and a velvety texture, while a light hopping with the Emerald variety allows the vanilla and red fruit aromas to fully unfold\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\r\n\r\nThis beer has been recognized for its excellence, notably being awarded as the best dark wheat beer in 2014. It's described as having a flavor profile that includes banana, clove, caramel, and spicy yeast, all contributing to a complex and satisfying taste experience\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b. Served at a temperature of around 16\u00b0C to best enjoy its flavors.",
