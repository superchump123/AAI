  "description": "When life gives you lemons throw them back and say, \u201cI wanted a mango.\u201d \u2013 Or have both!\r\nThis brew is refreshingly tart with a hint of sweet that will evoke images of sitting under a mango tree digging your toes into a sandy beach. Have your mango with a touch of lemon peel, coriander and pink Himalayan rock salt and enjoy a taste of the tropics any time you like. No beach required.",
