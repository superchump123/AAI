  "description": "When the weather starts to cool off in Florida \u2013 get ready for Father Christmas. Our spiced seasonal winter ale, it is a dark brown, rich ale that has a thick brown head and smells of mulling spices. The flavor is reminiscent of a Christmas cookie, with hints of clove, cinnamon, and ginger. This beer ages well and vintage releases are often available.",
