  "description": "While Trappist monks have brought us boldly flavored and highly octaned beers such as Tripels and Quadruples, the beer that they are most likely drinking themselves is a Singel or Patersbier. Like those monks, at Barrel of Monks you\u2019ll likely see us enjoying this clean and refreshing beer regularly as there is always something to be done and staying on even keel is key. It\u2019s both the perfect beer to begin your quest into the world of Belgian Ales and an ideal choice after a long day of toil and trouble.",
