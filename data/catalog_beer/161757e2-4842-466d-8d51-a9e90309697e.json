  "description": "Fruit beers are best when they are done subtly. Blending fruit and beer require more the precision of a scalpel than the brute force of a chainsaw. The Guava in our Single in Havana adds just a touch of sweetness and tropical fruit to our crisp, dry Single in Bruges producing a well-balanced beer.",
