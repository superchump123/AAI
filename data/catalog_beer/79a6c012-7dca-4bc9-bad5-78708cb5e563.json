  "description": "Convoluted And Hazy IPA (\u2018k\u00e4nv\u0259 lood\u0259d \u2018h\u0101z\u0113)\r\n\r\nThis \u2018k\u00e4nv\u0259 lood\u0259d \u2018h\u0101z\u0113 IPA was inspired by the great, hazy and juicy IPA\u2019s made in New England. We didn\u2019t lose our way on this interpretation of the style, as ours features Mosaic and Citra Hops and is our own!\r\n\r\nWe aren\u2019t inspired by their football, but their IPA\u2019s aren\u2019t half bad!",
